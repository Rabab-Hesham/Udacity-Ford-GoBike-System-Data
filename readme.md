# Ford GoBike System
## by Rabab Hesham


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area during February 2019. Data contains information about the trips' duration, start and end stations.
It doesn't contain any personal information about the users, but it contains the user's gender and member type.

## Summary of Findings

> During the exploration, I found that the number of trips decreases on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and increases on the working days, especially on Thursday. This tells us that the main use for the bike-sharing isn't for fun.
the high usage during the rush hours, especially during the working days confirms these findings.
So we can conclude that most of the users use the bike-sharing on their way to work. These Trips are usually short, around 10 minutes. Trips that longer than 30 minutes are not frequent.
During the weekend increases the purpose of using the bike-sharing for fun, a slight increase in the number of trips after midnight confirms these findings, and the duration of the trips is higher on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
Most users are men, and most of the member type is subscribers, and they don't use bike share for all trips. Most of the subscribers use the bike share for short trips.
 The most common ages for the users are between 23 to 33 years old, and interestingly, ride the women longer trips using bike share compared to men.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the Trip duration, and the number of trips, this reflects the user behavior. I introduce many categorical variables like member type, user gender, and start the day.
in the analysis is going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships. I used many kinds of graphs like histogram, bar plot, a heat map, a violin plot, and box plots.

The project contains 12 graphs as following:
1- The distribution of the trips during the week.
2- The distribution of the trips during the day.
3- The major user type.
4- The major user gender.
5- Do the users use the bike share for all the trips?
6-The distribution of members age across the data?
7- Trips' duration across the data
8- weekdays vs trip duration
9- weekdays vs start hour
10- user type vs member gender
11- User type and member gender vs trip duration
12- Start station vs user type
13- End station vs user type
14- Member gender vs user type vs the trip duration
15-Start day vs Start station id vs Member gender
16-Start day vs Trip duration in minutes vs Member gender
